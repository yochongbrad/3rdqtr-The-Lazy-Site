                                <p>It was one scary day, March 9, 2020, the first day of the Fourth Periodic Test. I thought that the assessment would be hard. But it was DIFFICULT. Fortunately, my memory served me right, and answered the exams. Until 3 in the afternoon when Mr. Mayor announced that classes are suspended for a week. A week had already passed, then the suspension of classes became the community quarantine that would last a month. A month had passed, the quarantine was extended another half a month. Half a month had past and the end of the enhanced community quarantine will be on further notice.
                                </p>
                                <p>Such a grateful time, no school works. All we need to do is to eat and sleep, of course, household chores, and maintaining physical hygiene. In the first stages of quarantine, all I did was to sleep and play Pokémon to get over the tiring school days. When I got enough rest good for a year, I realize that there was no productivity. My elder brother has saved the online courses for him to watch them offline. He passed them to me so that I can effectively spend my time.
                                </p>
                                <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading StyleSheet (CSS), used to design web online, were our lessons back in the 8th grade but I did not absorb what our teacher was teaching. “Alright!” I said to myself, this is the right time to master this. Within a couple of months, more than 6 hours a day, I finished the Web Design Course by Team Treehouse. I discovered that it was not difficult, no memorization needed. All I need is to apply my logical thinking. Since my artistic side exists, the design is not an obstacle for me in the world of Web Designing. It was the birth of my own-styled responsive web, The Lazy Site. I didn’t upload it because I’m not the owner of the pictures and the typeface I used.</p>
                                <p>A whole new knowledge is what I gifted to myself. Now, I obtain such wisdom that I can use soon no matter what my job is. But before we go to the near future of expectations, we must meet the reality of the present. I was joyful to hear that we will make our website, the excitement inside me exploded until I read “WordPress,” where you can’t make your ideal logo and design using CSS unless paid. But it is a pleasant continuation in my web designing journey.</p>

                                <p>Where I and my friends are connected</p>
                                <p>But nothing shines to my body are what I got from the sun</p>
                                <p>My activities inside the house were braindead</p>
                                <p>All I did was to clean the house without any drops of fun</p>
                                <br>
                                <p> Although my mind was lonely</p>

                                <p>I can play with my siblings; I am the player three</p>   
                                <p>Even though to each other we are each one’s enemy</p>    
                                <p>So far, we survived the vacation happily</p>   
                                <p>Here we go again, school is now open to professional-wannabe</p>

                                <p>I didn’t feel so far from the world physically</p>   
                                <p>Staying at home is what I used to be</p>    
                                <p>Nothing is different as long as having fun with friends and family</p>  
                                <p>Nor swimming mindlessly in the artificial sea</p>

                            <p>2020 is summarized and everything was exaggerated. This "mockumentary" brought laughter to this Hellish Year.</p>
                            <p>The extraordinary is shot in a mockumentary design, intercutting a progression of talking-head master characters with genuine film from the year and a voice-over from a legitimate storyteller (Laurence Fishburne). The principal hint to Death to 2020's comical inclination is the names it provides for its talking-head characters. Samuel L. Jackson plays Run Section, a writer for a distribution called the New Yorker News. Kumail Nanjiani is a morals free tech Chief named Bark Multiverse. Joe Keery, whose character is distinguished onscreen as "Gig Economy Millennial," gets the name Duke Goolies. A researcher played by Samson Kayo is left with the name Pyrex Flagon.</p>

                            <p>70% of the world's infectious diseases come from Wildlife.
                            Wildlife comes in contact with humans because of lost habitat. The largest cause of their habitat loss is deforestation.
                            Agricultural purposes such as farms and raising livestock, are one of the main causes of deforestation.
                            How deforestation and urbanization connected? Urban growth drives deforestation in at least two ways. First, as rural migrants to cities adopt city-based lifestyles, they tend to use more resources. Their incomes rise and their diets shift to a greater share of animal products and processed foods.</p>

                            <p>This is not the end for poor patients being ignored because of money. Public hospitals should be free for everyone.
                                These helpful wills isn't his 9th symphony yet.
                                This episode was about a dying doctor who still cures and takes care of other dying patients.
                                No money, no treatment. Communication is the key, New Amsterdam's staff doesn't having live group conversation to resolve patient's problem about insurance.
                                Hardest choices require the strongest wills. Only Max has the will to initiate giving insurance to poor.
                                Public Hospitals must be free for all patients.</p>
                            <p>These are common in the Philippines, powerful personalities take advantages to people who has lesser power. Not only in medical issues especially now during the pandemic, but also in other aspects. From the basics, Barber's Shop, sometimes, the more money you give to the barber, the more likely he'll cut you first. To complicated ones, big example is about the court where it is The Victim vs The Culprit. If the victim is poor, and the culprit is very rich, with his money, he can buy the attorney and the judges.</p>
